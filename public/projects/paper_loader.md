Paper Loader is a simple webpack loader to load in PaperJS sketches into a compiled project. PaperJS's API is relies on using the html tags on a paperjs script element which can make it awkward to include into a webpack project. I made this for a project of my own to easily include PaperJS's special javascript format (It includes vector arithmetic). By using this you can load sketches straight into your react or webpack based app.
