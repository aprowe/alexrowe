Puzzle League is a browser game made in CoffeeScript. It replicates the gameplay of games such as Tetris Attack and Pok√©mon Puzzle League. The pixel art, music and coding was all done by myself. It was enjoyable to see it come together as a finished game.
I used CreateJS as a framework for it, which isn't necessarily a game engine,
it was fun to create my own mini game framework in the process.
